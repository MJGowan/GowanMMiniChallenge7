Mini Challenge 7 - Redo
In this program the user input must be reversed. It should reverse whether it's a string or a number.

Peer Review: Brandon Le - overall the program did what it was meant to do and it reversed the strings and numbers. Play again function worked as intended I was able to hit yes to play again and any other typing, no or anything other than yes will end the program. Good job! If there was one small thing to add I would do data validation for the "If you would like to play again" at the end. So if user accidentally types ys ye or some other typo instead of yes, it won't end the program and it would allow them to properly input yes. But very good job :)
